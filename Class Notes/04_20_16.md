## Sequential vs Binary sort

  Sequential sort:
    Worst case: n (n=#entries in the array)
    Ex:
| seq         | #comps | probability |
| a\[0] ? key |   1    |   p/n       |
| a\[1] ? key |   2    |   p/n       |
| ...         |   ...  |   ...       |
| a\[n]? key  |   n    |   p/n       |
| not found   |   n    |   1-p       |

      Assumptions
        1) The key is equally likely to be found at any index in the array
        2) The probability that the key will be found in the array is known to equal p
          - (0 <= p <= 1)

      Avg case is E(x) where X = # comparisons
        E(x) = 1 * p/n + 2 * p/n + 3 * p/n + ... + n * p/n + n(1-p)
             = (1 + 2 + 3 + ... + n)p/n + n(1-p)
             = (n(n+1)/2)(p/n) + n(1-p)
             = ((n+1)/2)(p) + n(1-p)
          p=0, f(x) = n
          p=1, f(x) = (n+1)/2

  Binary:
    Worst-case: b = # of bits in the binary representation of n
    Ex:
| binary      | #comps | probability |
| a\[0] ? key |   3    |   p/n       |
| a\[1] ? key |   2    |   p/n       |
| ...         |   1    |   ...       |
| a\[n]? key  |   2    |   p/n       |
| not found   |   3    |   p/n       |

    b-?   1-p
    p/n + b(1-p)
      = (nb - (2^b - 1 - b))(p/n) + b(1-p)
      = b - (p(2^b - 1 - b))/n

      n + n-1 + n-3 + n-7
      n - (2^(b-1)-1)
      2^(b-1) <= 2^b-1             = n*b - (2^b - 1 - b)

      -1(1+3+7+15...+(2^(b-1)-1))
        =(2^b)-2 - (b-1)
        =2^(b-1) -

    (2^b -1 -b)/n <= (2^b -1 -b)/(2^n-1) = 2 - (b+1)/(2^(b-1)) < 2

    worst case: becomes sequential search, long string to one direction

  Prop: any searching algorithm on a sorted array takes at least as many steps
    or comparisons as binary search performs (in the worst case)

      n+1 outcomes that must appear in the flowchart
      if q is the number of comparisons, then
        2^6 >= n+1
        2^q - 1 >= n
        = 1111111
        so q is at least the # of lists in the binary representation of n

  So b-search is the best, but also kind of terrible
    needs to be sorted properly
    demands perfect input in order to work

## Random Binary Tree

  Ex: Randomly
    Don't know what's coming, they come in randomly

    - build a tree with 2 kinds of nodes
    - 4-node, 3-node, 2-nodes

## Red-Black  Trees

    Rules
      1) Black balance: any path from the root to the leaves include the same # black nodes
      2) No red node has a red child

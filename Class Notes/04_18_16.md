## Heapsort

    Top down

    Bottom Up
      start from bottom
      Assume subheaps for all generations
      Fuse subheaps up to contain the new element
      Compare to find bigger, swap if necessary with new
      If new swaps down, then left is ok, right has to keep checking for its spot

  Worst cases

    Top-down
      2 comparisons and swaps for each on the same level

      2^k <= n < 2^(k+1)

      n-(2^k - 1)

      1     0
      4     1
      4/3   2
      8     3
      2^(k-1) * k - 1
      [n - (2^k - 1)] * k

      10
      100       100
      1000      1000      1000
      |
      |
      |
      100-0     100-1     100-0 ...  100000
      k bits

      add them up...
      1111111110 + 1111111100 + 1-1000 ... 10-0
      2^k-2 * 2^k - 4  * 2^k - 8   * 2^k - 2^(k-1) =(2^k-1)
      = (k-1) * 2^k - (2 + 2^2 + 2^3 + ... + 2^k-1) + (k-1) * 2^k - (2^k - 2)
      = (k-2) * 2^k + 2

      (k-2) * 2^k + 2                 \<- total for bottom row
      + (n - 2^k + 1) * k             \<- total for everything else
      -------------------
      = n*k + k - 2^(k+1) + 2

      2^k <= n < 2^(k + 1)
      k = floor(log2 n)

    Bottom Up: worst case -> already sorted
      going up to k
      total # swaps will be nunber of parents
        1 if parent, 2 if grandparent or more, 3 if great grandparent
         do for each generation and each generation up
        # parents + # grandparents # + # great grandparents ...
      floor(n/2) parents

    (k-2) * 2^k + 2
    + k(n - 2^k + 1)
    n * k + k - 2^(k+1) + 2 = O(nlogn)

    bkbk-1bk-2 parents, grandparents ...
    (2^k - 1)b_k + (2^(k-1) - 1)b_(k-1) + ... + (2-1)b_1
    n - bitsum(n)
    so just about O(n)

    But that was just building the heap

    Now sorting the heap:
    sort - swap front to back if needed
    Number of levels
      log(n-1)
      log(n-2)
      ...
      log(2)
      log(1)
      +
      --------
      log(n-1)!
      nlog(n)
       ***so O(nlogn)***

       Best possible we can get for this sort of thing
       Best possible behavior for a sorting alogrithm
       AND IT DOESN'T USE EXTRA SPACE

## Searching an array

  Problem: given an array a\[i] of n entries at an item to search for, key
    return key -> a\[i] = key
     or
    not found if there is no such i

  Sequential seaerch
    not found is the worst case
    a\[0] ?= key
    a\[1] ?= key
    ...
    a\[n] ?= key

    comparisons O(n)

  Binary Search
    a\[mid]=?key
      key\<a\[mid]
        binary-search on a\[0] ... a\[mid-1]
          ceiling((n-1)/2
      key >a\[mid]
        binary-search on a\[mid+1] ... a\[n]
          floor((n-1)/2)
    Total number searches? O(logn) comparisons for not found

  More precisely, the worst-case of comparisons (not found) is
    the number of bits in the binary representation of n
    (floor(log n) + 1)

    T(n) = # of comparisons in not found case for an array size n
      T(n) = 1 + T(ceiling((n-1)/2))
           = 1 + T(floor(n2))

      note: ceiling((n-1)/2) = floor(n/2)
      n=2m -> m
      n=2m+1 -> m

      look at binary expansion
      n in binary -> b_k...b_2 b_1
      so number of bits

    Binary search does the fewest number of searches of all algorithms
    Can we do better?

  Define a heap

    - A heap is a binary tree
    - Complete to the last generation
    - All child nodes on the left, no child nodes on the right
    - Up to 1 one-child node, on the left
    - The last generation is descendents # of children and at most are 1 child node (left child)
    - Each node has sosme data which can be compared to the data of the other node
    - Each parent has a value that is greater than or equal to its children's data

    - can be implemented as an array
      - doesn't need a new data structure
    - use index
    - a[i], a[2i], a[2i+1]
    - double -> add on a 0, double+1 -> add on a 1
    - up to parent: a[int(i/2)] //lop off the right bit

    1) Build the heap from random order
    2) Repair the heap after swapping off the largest element

    1.a) Top-down method
      - few comparisons, swaps
      - compare to parent, maybe swap it up a generation
      - Each new entry compared to parents, swapping as necessary, until either the new entry loses
        - or ends up at the top of the heap
    1.b) Bottom-up method
      - working from the right rather than the left
      - adding until big heap across
      - order swapping, repeat operation of compares
      - Let new one fall to proper position
      - Repeatedly add new parents on top of previously ordered subheaps
        - compare tops of subheaps
        - compare the largest top to the new entry, swap if necessary
        - Repeat at subsequent levels
      - Bottom-Up is better

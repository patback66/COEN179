## Definition of Algorithm

## Big O notation

    n = input size
    f(n) = # of steps the 1st algorithm uses to solve the problem
    g(n) = # of steps teh 2nd algorithm uses to solve the problem

      there exists C>0
      there exists N>0
        such that f(n) <= C g(n) for all n>N (essentially, eventually)

      we say that f(n) = O(g(n)) //really no worse than, not equal to


    Ex:
        sqrt(n^4 + 2n^2 +18) = O(n^2)

        sqrt(n^4 + 2n^2 + 18) <= sqrt(n^4 + 2n^4 + 8n^4) = sqrt(21n^4) = sqrt(21)n^2

        C = sqrt(21)
        N=1

        But

            = sqrt(n^2 + 2n^2 + 18) = O(n^3)
            but n^5 != O(sqrt(n^4 + 2n^2 + 18))

            if f(n)=O((g(n))
            and g(n)=O(f(n))
            we write f(n)=theta(g(n))
            (g(n)=theta(f(n)))

        Negating:

            f(n) != O(g(n))
            means for every C>0 f(n)>Cg(n) infinitely often

        sqrt(n^4 + 2n^2 + 18) <= sqrt(21)n^2
        Csqrt(n^4 + 2n^2 + 18) <= Csqrt(21)n^2< n^5

            n^5>n^2 * Csqrt(21)
            n^3 > C sqrt(21)
            n > cbrt(Csqrt(21))

## Sorting

  Insertion Sort
    Worst Case Behavior O(n^2) (worst case # swaps n(n-1)/2)
    Average Case Behavior: E(x)
      X = # swaps performed by insertion sort
      Assume all ordering are equally likely
      E(x) = sum(1/n!(#of swaps for particular ordering), all possible orders)
           = 1/n! sum(# of swaps performed, all possible cases)
           = sum(swaps performed)/n!

  Ex:
    Random
    AR
    ARN
    ANR
    ANRD
    ANDR
    ADNR
    ADNRO
    ADNOR
    ADNORM
    ADNOMR
    ADNMOR
    ADMNOR

    Swaps:
      RA
      RN
      RD
      ND
      RO
      RM
      OM
      NM

    Definiton
      if i<j but a[i]>a[j]
      we call the pair a[i] and a[j] a transposition

      every transposition gives 1 swap

    1/n! sum(# of all transpositions, all possible orders)

    Backwards Version
      MD
      MA
      OD
      ON
      OA
      DA
      NA
      -> 7 transpositions
      -> if it's not a transposition going forwards, it is backwards. And vice versa

    E(x) = 1/n! sum(#of transpositions going forwards)
    E(x) = 1/n! sum(#of transpositions going backwards)
    2E(x) = 1/n! sum(# of pairs) //# pairs the same no matter the ordering
          = n(n-1)/2
    E(x) = n(n-1)/4 = O(n^2)

## Selection Sort

  find the smallest, wherever it goes, move it to the front
  find the second smalles, move it to second to the front, etc...
  SELECTION
  CELESTION
  CELESTION
  CEELSTION
  ...

  n-1 comparisons 1 swap
  n-2 comaprisons 1 swap
  ...
  1 comparison 1 swap
  -> n(n-1)/2 comparisons
  -> up to n-1 swaps = O(n) ** BETTER -> SMALLER NUMBER

## Merge Sort

  Merge sort left half, merge sort right half
  merge the two into one sorted
  give extra space, copy into extra space
  one half can be sorted in the opposite order, compare outside in

  [Mergesort](http://math.scu.edu/~bwalden/alg/merge.cc)

  [Mergesort Example](http://math.scu.edu/~bwalden/alg/merge.html)

  T(n) = # of comparisons to mergesort an array of n entries
    same # independent of order
    comparisons of left, right, merge
    = T(ceiling(n/2)+T(floor(n/2))+n
    T(1) = 0

## Master Theorem

    b subproblems of size n/b
    let a = # of subproblems you have to do
    T(n) = aT(n/b) + f(n)
      //f is amount of extra steps at level n

    Special case: f(n) = 0
      T(n) = aT(n/b) = a\[aT(n/b^2)] = a^2T(n/b^2) = a^3T(n/b^3)
      T(n/b) = aT((n/b)/b)
             = aT(n/b^2)
      T(n/b^2) = aT(nb^3)
        b^k <= n < b^(k+1)
        1<= n/b^k < b
        =
